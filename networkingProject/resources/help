As you may have noticed, all the commands start with a slash "/".
If you don't type it, you'll be sending a message to all your colleagues. Use the chat to come up with better strategies in group! 
Below, you'll find the list of all the commands. If curly brackets "{}" are shown, it means it's an optional argument. Rectangular ones "[]" are for mandatory fields.
But anyway, here's the list of all the commands: 
 
 -------- GENERAL COMMANDS ------- 
 /help                           => duh, you're here already? It takes you to this very text, with all the commands... so HELPful! 
 /status                         => check your current STATUS. Very useful! 
 /skill [skill number] {target}  => use a SKILL! Check the list of UNIQUE SKILLS 
 /defend                         => DEFEND yourself. You'll still suffer a bit of damage if attacked. 
 /pick                           => PICK the loot before you clear the room! But remember that each item is only useful to one of the adventurers. 
 /w [player Name] [message]      => through it you can WHISPER whatever you want to the player that you specified. 
 /revive                         => you can only REVIVE in specific situations (and if you're dead of course - yes your ghost will keep on watching everything). 
 /quit                           => why would you want to QUIT the game? Do that and everybody will hate you!
