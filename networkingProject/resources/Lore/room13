You read a message on the wall:

"...And even those Commerce Guilds are controlled by someone else. They are owned by this very powerful family, the PharMages.
 They live far far away from the attention of the people. From their Ivory tower they watch and control the world, not just USAK.

 They own everything. They produce everything. This war, this chaos. It's them. They created the USAK system, they created
 DAESH, All-Keda, etc.

 Their interest is to keep their power and to do that, they need to maintain a certain balance:
 - people must be fearful and separated from each other. Divide and Rule.
 - but not too divided, or a civil war might happen, and that's not always beneficial (it is sometimes).

 On the next room I'll tell you who I am."
