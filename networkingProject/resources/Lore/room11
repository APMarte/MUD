You find another message on a wall:

"...Before Osama of the Barracks, there was Georgie, the Bushtard Junior. He was an idiot, though Trumpet is Eons ahead
 on that matter. He was the one starting the errorist war. Many many people died, Armedicans as well.
 Worst than that, it all started a bigger wave of paranoia about people from different ethnicities and religions.
 You can see the results today with those fearful and angry people empowering Trumpet and vice-versa.

 The "greatest country in the world" at the hands of such people: not so great anymore..."
