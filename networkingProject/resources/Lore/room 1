Yet again, there's a sign on the wall:

"The USAK is a group of Kingdoms occupying almost a whole Continent, and it's ruled by an emperor elected every 4 years.
 Why would an Emperor be in power for only 8 years maximum? There are 3 main reasons:

 1 - It’s a very coveted position by all the kings of USAK.
 2 - It’s a very demanding job, which literally takes away a big part of the emperor’s vitality, reducing his/her lifespan.
 3 - There are 2 big groups in power: the Rightfools and the DemoCrafties. They rotate to avoid a civil war.

 The Rightfools are more conservative, their symbol is an elephant.
 The DemoCrafties are more liberal, their symbol is a donkey."
