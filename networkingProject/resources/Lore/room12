You quickly find the message on the wall:

"...Before this, there were peaceful times. Nothing much happened during Bill's reign. It's funny how it was a scandal
 the thing with his scribe, and today, just a few years later, much more serious things being ignored.

 However, even in peaceful times things can keep on being rotten.

 It's not about the actual person that the emperor is.
 Or about which group he/she belongs too.
 The actual rulers of the empire are not the emperors but the Big Commerce Guilds. There's the rockoil one we talked about,
 but many many more.
 And all of them have money and power to influence Kings, political groups, Emperors..."
