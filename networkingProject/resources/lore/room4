Written on the wall it can be read:

 "...Because of this, the Armedicans started a war in Ire Kingdom, to "set it free" from its evil king, Sodom Hussein.
  Did I say "Armedicans"? I meant SAKers!
  Yes, they executed Sodom Hussein, a cruel leader.
  But what did they actually wanted? Rockoil, lots and lots of rockoil: the thing used nowadays for all kinds of purposes.

  Armedican Emperors speak of Truth, Justice and Freedom, but it's all about Power and Money.
  If, among other things, you control the Rockoil you control everything!
  No wonder its allies came running as well..."
